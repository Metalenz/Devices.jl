A modified version of `adaptive_grid` was originally from PlotUtils.jl, an MIT "Expat"
licensed Julia package by Tom Breloff and contributors (notably Kristoffer Carlsson).

Cadence Design Systems, Inc. holds the rights to the GDS-II format. The specification has
been described with permission in the SPIE Handbook of Microlithography, Micromachining and
Microfabrication, vol. 1 (accessible [here](http://www.cnf.cornell.edu/cnf_spie9.html) as of
April 17, 2017).

The file `src/predicates.jl` contains a Julia adaptation of public domain C code written by
Jonathan Richard Shewchuk. Available at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/robust.html.
